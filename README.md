# Bitcart Admin Panel

[![CI](https://github.com/bitcart/bitcart-admin/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bitcart/bitcart-admin/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This is the Bitcart Admin Panel.

It is created to simplify usage of Bitcart Merchants API,
making adding or editing data easy, plus containing a checkout page which can be used by various integrations.

The admin panel always covers 100% of the Merchants API.
